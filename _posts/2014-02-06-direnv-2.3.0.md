title: direnv 2.3.0 - exec away
layout: default
---

Big thanks to [gfxmonk](https://github.com/gfxmonk)
again, this time for submitting the DIRENV_LOG_FORMAT change that allows users
to change the log output. Direnv's output is still not very pretty but it's
starting to get better. Example: `export DIRENV_LOG_FORMAT='üìÅ %s'`

We also have a new `direnv exec [DIR] <COMMAND> ...` command spearheaded by
[pwaller](https://github.com/pwaller) which allows to execute commands in
the context of an env. [bencolon](https://github.com/bencolon) provided us
with a usage example for his sublime text plugin:
https://github.com/zimbatm/direnv/pull/97#issuecomment-33840368

Both new feature lack in documentation and in general documentation is still a
big issue. It's hard to write and takes time to maintain. Next month I'll be
focusing on that, hopefully making it easier for non-gurus to join the
project.
